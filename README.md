### Student Depression Analysis

### Project Statement :

The Student Depression Analysis project aims to analyze patterns of depression among students using SQL for data transformation and Tableau for visual representation. The goal is to uncover key insights related to mental health by categorizing students based on demographics and depression levels, ensuring clean and structured data for better decision-making.

## Key Features Include

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation in SQL
To ensure data accuracy and consistency, several modifications were made:

- Created New Columns:

 -Age Group: Categorized students into different age groups (e.g., A1,A2 and A3) to analyze trends across different age brackets.

-Index Column: Added an index for unique identification of records.

- Modified Column Data Types & Values:

  -Depression Column:

  Changed its data type to better suit the analysis.

 -Standardized depression levels (e.g., converting numeric    scores    like '0' and '1' to textual values like 'YES' and 'NO') 

 -Gender Column:

 Standardized gender values (e.g., converting “Male”  and “Female” into simple values like "M” and"F").

 Ensured data consistency for better analysis.

2. Data Analysis Using SQL Queries

After cleaning, SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights, such as:

A. Percentage of students showing signs of depression by age group.

B. Gender-wise distribution of depression levels.

C.  Average depression score for different categories.

3. Data Visualization in Tableau

Once the data was structured, it was imported into Tableau to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards. The following key visualizations were included:

## Key Relationships Explored:

-Academic Pressure vs. Student Count

 This visualization highlights how the number of students experiencing depression varies based on academic workload. It helps identify whether increased pressure leads to higher stress levels.

-Study Hours vs. Student Count

 By analyzing the correlation between study hours and depression, this chart reveals if extended study sessions contribute to mental health struggles.

-Financial Stress vs. Student Count

 Financial difficulties can be a major stressor for students. This visualization shows how financial challenges impact student depression rates.

-Study Satisfaction vs. Student Count

 Understanding whether students who enjoy their studies experience less depression is crucial. This visualization helps assess the impact of academic satisfaction on mental well-being.
